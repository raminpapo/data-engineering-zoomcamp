## Getting your certificate

Congratulations on finishing the course!

You can find your certificate in your enrollment profile (you need to be logged in):

* For the 2025 edition, it's https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/enrollment

If you can't find a certificate in your profile, it means you didn't pass the project.
If you believe it's a mistake, write in the course channel in Slack.


## Adding to LinkedIn

You can add your certificate to LinkedIn:

* Log in to your LinkedIn account, then go to your profile.
* On the right, in the "Add profile" section dropdown, choose "Background" and then select the drop-down triangle next to "Licenses & Certifications".
* In "Name", enter "Data Engineering Zoomcamp".
* In "Issuing Organization", enter "DataTalksClub".
* (Optional) In "Issue Date", enter the time when the certificate was created.
* (Optional) Select the checkbox This certification does not expire. 
* Put your certificate ID.
* In "Certification URL", enter the URL for your certificate.
